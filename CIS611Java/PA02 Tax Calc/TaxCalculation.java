		// There is no need to enter a comma in the income, but enter the income as 15125, or 67897 etc.
		// The code above gets the income value of the person income in the variable income.
		// However, this data type is String. In other words, even if the value of the data is indeed of type integer, the data type is String.
		// You can to convert the String data type to to into double type.
		// use the parseDouble to convert String data type to double.
		// the data type is kept as double, because to calculate the tax, you have to multiply with values as 0.1 etc.
		double icomeInDouble=Double.parseDouble(incomeInputVaue);  
		// Now you have the income value in data type int in the variable icomeInDouble.
		// You will use the icomeInDouble for the tax calculation for the person. 
		
		// Next, let us show the example of how to get the status of the person.
		// The status of the person is can be wither single, or married.
		// If the user enters an input value of 0, then code it as the status of the person as single.
		// If the user enters an input value of 1, then code it as the status of the person as single.
		// Showing below how to get the input value of the status of the person using JOptionPane
		String statusInString =JOptionPane.showInputDialog("Enter status of person, Enter either the value of Single, or Married.");  
		// Next, you will use switch statement to convert the status to a value of either 0, or 1.
		// If the value entered in the input above input is Single, then assign a value of 1.
		// If the value entered in the input above married, then assign a value of 1.
		// Create a new variable to hold the status, and the data type of this new variable is int.
		int statusInInt = 0; // declare a variable for that, and initialize to a value
		// The value entered has to exactly match as Single (or Married) because the switch statement below looks for those values
