/*  Suppose you want to know which words in the argument list occur only once and which occur more than once, but you do not want any duplicates printed out repeatedly. This effect can be achieved by generating two sets â€” one containing every word in the argument list and the other containing only the duplicates. The words that occur only once are the set difference of these two sets
