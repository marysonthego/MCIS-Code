        <p>Color is inherited. <br><br>
        Width, margin, padding, and border are not inherited.</p>
        <p>Control inheritance with 4 universal property values:
            <ul>
                <li><span>inherit</span> Turns on inheritance.</li>
                <li><span>initial</span> Sets the property value applied 
                    to a selected element to be the same as 
                    the value set for that property on that 
                    element in the browser's default style sheet. 
                    If no value is set by the browser's default style 
                    sheet and the property is naturally inherited, 
                    then the property value is set to inherit instead.</li>
                <li><span>unset</span> Resets the property to its natural value, 
                    which means that if the property is naturally 
                    inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it acts like initial.
                </li>
                <li><span>revert</span> (New) Reverts the cascaded value of the property 
                    from its current value to the value the property would 
                    have had if no changes had been made by the current 
                    style origin to the current element. Thus, it resets 
                    the property to its inherited value if it inherits from 
                    its parent or to the default value established by the 
                    user agent's stylesheet (or by user styles, if any exist). 
                    It can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand all. 
                    This removes from the cascade all of the styles that have been 
                    overridden until the style being rolled back to is reached. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <ul class="main">
            <li>The color has applied to the direct children, but also the indirect children
                 â€” the immediate child &lt;li&gt;s, and those inside the first nested list. 
            </li>
            <li>Item One</li>
            <li>Item Two
                <ul>
                    <li>2.1</li>
                    <li>2.2</li>

                <ul class="special">
                    <li>We have then added a class of special to the second nested list and 
                        applied a different color to it. This then inherits down 
                        through its children.
