    <br><br> Target multiple selectors at once by separating the selectors with a comma.
    <br><br>To select a subset of the elements without changing the others,
            add a class to your HTML element and target that class.
    <br><br>target any li element that has a class of special:
    <br><br>li.special {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: orange;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-weight: bold;
      <br>}<br><br>
      To select only an &lt;em&gt; that is nested inside an &lt;li&gt; element use a 
      selector called the descendant combinator, which simply takes the form of a 
      space between two other selectors:<br><br>
      li em {<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;color: rebeccapurple;<br>
      }
    <br><br>To style a paragraph when it comes directly after a heading at 
        the same hierarchy level in the HTML place a +  (an adjacent sibling combinator) 
        between the selectors.<br><br>
        h1 + p {<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 200%<br>
        }<br><br>

    <p>This is a paragraph of text. In the text is a <span class="special">span element</span> 
and also a <a href="http://example.com">link</a>.</p>

    <p>This is the second paragraph. It contains an <em>emphasized</em> element.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Item one</li>
        <li class="special">Item two</li>
        <li>Item <em>three</em></li>
    </ul>
<p>An internal stylesheet is where you don't have an external CSS file, 
    but instead place your CSS inside a &lt;style&gt; element contained inside the HTML &lt;head&gt;.
</p>
<p>A property paired with a value is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are put within CSS 
    Declaration Blocks. CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS Rulesets (or CSS Rules).
</p>
<p> Both properties and values are case-sensitive in CSS. The property and value in each pair 
    is separated by a colon (:).</p>
