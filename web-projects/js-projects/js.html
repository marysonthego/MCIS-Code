    <p>There are other ways to call functions. There are often cases 
    where a function needs to be called dynamically, or the number of 
    arguments to a function vary, or in which the context of the 
    function call needs to be set to a specific object determined at 
    runtime.<br><br>
    functions are themselves objectsâ€”and in turn, 
    these objects have methods. (See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function">Function</a> object.)</a>
    One of these, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply">apply()</a>
     method, can be used to achieve this goal.</p>
    <button>Click me</button>
    <button>Another one</button>
    <p>Template literals are enclosed by the back-tick (` `) (grave accent) 
        character instead of double or single quotes. Template literals can 
        contain place holders. These are indicated by the Dollar sign and 
        curly braces (${expression}).</p>
